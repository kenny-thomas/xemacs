# List of problems with XEmacs. If anyone wants to work on these, please
# mail me and I'll update the table below.

1. vfork references
2. provide working select which supports handles as well as sockets
3. make "Save Options" actually save options to home directory. Currently I get
   it trying to save in g:\home\davidh\~davidh
4. build a binary distribution (just install temacs and get user to _easily_
   build an xemacs.exe on their system. This will ensure heap problems do not
   occur)
5. provide option for dired to use dir/attrib on Win32 platforms
6. verify MULE supports CRLF correctly
7. get subprocesses working
