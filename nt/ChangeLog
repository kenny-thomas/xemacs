	* Synced with 20.3b2.

	* Removed nt/README.src, nt/src.m.windowsnt.h nt/src.s.windowsnt.h.

	* Updated README from marcpa.

	* Added example Win32.cf and site.def files for X.

	* Added sed.exe into nt/.

	* Modified nt/xemacs.mak to pass correct flags to lwlib compile.

	* Added extra .elc files to ensure make-docfile gets all symbols.

	* Modified balloon_help.c to compile (#if'd max definition)

	* Modified src/event-Xt.c so as not to add signal_event_pipe to
          be selected on - this is a hack until I can work out a better
          way. Thanks to Ben Wing for help on this.

	* lisp/eterm/README.term is truncated: is it just me (because
	I'm on NT) or everyone else sees this ?
	Answer: it is because it contains a ^Z embedded in it, therefore
	it needs to be inserted in binary mode in CVS.

	* At end of compilation, there are some unresolved symbols: 

link.exe @C:\TEMP\nma00115.
sysdep.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _vfork
../src/temacs.exe : warning LNK4088: image being generated due to /FORCE
option; image may not run

	* Need to copy the nt/inc directory David originally submitted or
	NT code won't compile.

	* Need to copy nt/{config.h,paths.h,ad2c.sed,xemacs.mak} in src.

	* Had to modify XEmacs sources here and there : see the diffs
	between NT_FIRST_COMPILE and V20_1_beta9.

	* Needed to patch X11R6.3 sources: (include/x11/Xmd.h:155) BOOL is
	already defined by Windows and is a long, while X wants it to be
	an unsigned char.

	* cpp.exe not used: cl.exe from VC++4.2 seems to handle everything
	properly. 

NOTES:

Compilation with nmake -f xemacs.mak.

Using X11R6.3 for NT.

Work started with 20.1b2.
