	     Building and Installing XEmacs on Windows NT

			     David Hobley

Currently XEmacs for NT is in an early stage of development. Only X support
works at the moment, although native GUI/terminal support will be added at a
later date. If anyone wants to help with this, please contact us.

The port was made much easier by the groundbreaking work of Geoff Voelker
and others who worked on the GNU Emacs port to NT. Their version is available
from http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html

To get it working you will need:

1. An X server. MI/X is available on the Internet for free; It is 
   available from:  http://www.microimages.com/www/html/freestuf/mixdlfrm.htm
2. The MIT X11R6.3 libraries available from: ftp.x.org
3. You'll need to compile the MIT libraries without multi-thread support.
   To do this, there is an example Win32.cf and site.def provided which
   set the relevant flags. You will also need to apply the patch in 
   nt/X11.patch in the xc/lib/X11 directory which will fix the DLL definition
   file. Once compiled and installed, you will need to apply the following
   patch to Xmd.h. This is messy and better solutions would be appreciated.

4. You will need Visual C++ V4.2 or later to compile everything. Personally we
   have tested V4.2 and V5.0.
5. Grab the latest XEmacs beta from ftp.xemacs.org if necessary. All nt
   support is in the nt/ subdirectory.
6. Edit the xemacs.mak file and ensure variables point to the correct place.
   Note that Visual C++ assumes a couple of environment variables INCLUDE and
   LIB to be set which specify the location of the includes and libraries.
7. Copy the files Emacs.ad.h, config.h and paths.h from nt/ to src/.
   Note, to rebuild Emacs.ad.h a sed script is run. SED for NT is available
   from the Virtually Unix site: http://www.itribe.net/virtunix
   This is not required however in normal operation.
8. Run make. I simply use nmake -f xemacs.mak.
9. Change directory to the src/ directory and run the temacs executable
   manually:
                temacs -batch -l loadup.el dump
   This will produce an xemacs.exe which can be run in conjunction with your
   X server.
