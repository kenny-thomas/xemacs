This is a skeletal packages hierarchy that will (eventually) be installed
if it doesn't already exist.  Installing XEmacs packages into this directory
in the build area is a mistake.

Subdirectories:

etc/
This directory is added to the data-directory-list and is used for storing
data files needed by Lisp packages at run-time.  This includes things like
image files, sound files, etc.

info/
This directory is added to the Info-default-directory-list and is used for
storing info documentation meant to be accessed when the user hits `C-h i'.

lisp/
This directory and all its subdirectories are added recursively to the
`load-path' at dump time.  All auto-autoloads.el files found are dumped with
XEmacs.
