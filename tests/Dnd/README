This path contains test code for the new XEmacs
Drag'n'Drop code.

Currently only drags are of interest. The internal
functions only work for OffiX. MSWindows and CDE
are broken with this patch.

The OffiX functions in mouse.el also work no longer,
because drags are now misc-user-events.

The misc-user-event now also responds as a button-x-event
to the event-* query functions.

The function of a drag is called dragdrop-drop-dispatch
as you can see in droptest.el. From within the function
you can access the actual misc-user-event through the
current-mouse-event variable.

dragtest.el works theoretically, but it needs to be
adapted to some new scheme fitting the drop code.

Short description of the object part of a drop misc-user-event:
( TYPE . DATA )
TYPE is either the symbol dragdrop_MIME
     or the symbol dragdrop_URL

DATA is a list of URL strings if TYPE is dragdrop_URL
     if TYPE is dragdrop_MIME DATA is either a string
     which contains the MIME data, or it is a list of
     ( CONTENT-TYPE CONTENT-ENCODING MIME-DATA )

     For DATA I am thinking of some different scheme:
     perhaps it would be more efficient to split the
     MIME data into header and body, make a plist from
     the header (for easy access), pre-convert the body
     to 8bit, and also attach the original data.
     This would make the access easier, but it would
     require that I do a lot of MIME stuff in C, a thing
     that tm-mime-view already does for us.
