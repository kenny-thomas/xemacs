This path contains test code for the new XEmacs
Drag'n'Drop code.

Currently only drops are of interest. The internal
functions only work for OffiX and MSWindows. CDE
is broken with this.

The OffiX functions in mouse.el also work no longer,
because drops are now misc-user-events.

The misc-user-event now also responds as a button-x-event
to the event-* query functions.

The function of a drag is called dragdrop-drop-dispatch
as you can see in droptest.el. From within the function
you can access the actual misc-user-event through the
current-mouse-event variable.

dragtest.el works theoretically, but it needs to be
adapted to some new scheme fitting the drop code (droptest.el
has it's own dragsources).

Short description of the object part of a drop misc-user-event:
( TYPE . DATA )
TYPE is either the symbol dragdrop_MIME
     or the symbol dragdrop_URL

DATA is a list of URL strings if TYPE is dragdrop_URL
     if TYPE is dragdrop_MIME DATA is either a string
     which contains the MIME data, or it is a list of
     ( CONTENT-TYPE CONTENT-ENCODING MIME-DATA )
     CONTENT-TYPE is encoded for tm-view (list, first element type,
	rest key.value conses)
     CONTENT-ENCODING is a string
     MIME-DATA is a string

     CONTENT-TYPE and -ENCODING can be directly supplied to mime/viewer-mode.
