# List of problems with XEmacs. If anyone wants to work on these, please
# mail me and I'll update the table below.

# Core NT issues
    1. Subprocess support is completely broken. 
    2. Networking support is completely broken. This is due to the fact that
       the model relies on the subprocess support also working. 
    4. No binary release. We know a binary release would be A Good Thing.
       However we want to make things stable before producing one so we don't
       have to field too many problems. Sorry. 
    5. Support for dired is perhaps not quite there. We need to port ls-lisp.el
       from FSF Emacs. 
    6. Currently the backup files do not get the same permissions as the file
       being edited. August Hill is looking at this one. 
    7. Verify that CRLF issues are dealt with correctly. Marc Paquette is
       looking at this. 

# X issues
    1. Redrawing on my (davidh) system seems fairly broken - I don't know if
       this is the XEmacs redraw functionality, my X server or just something
       strange with X under NT. Has anyone else experiences with this ?

# Native GUI issues
    1. Mouse drags can cause aborts. I think this is because the timeout
       implementation is broken and can cause the same timeout to go
       off twice (especially during mouse drags?), which makes XEmacs abort.
       Windows95 doesn't appear to provide any one-shot timers (NT does).
    2. XEmacs starts-up with "Arithmetic error".
    3. It might be a good idea if someone sanity-checked my (jhar) changes to
       faces.el.
    4. w32-make-font-foo in w32/w32-faces.el need to be written.
    5. Calling mouse_[enter|leave]_frame_hook.
    6. Eliminate resizing funnies
    7. Scrollbar
    8. Menubar
    9. Palette handling
   10. Middle mouse button emulation. Dragging off-frame.
   11. Images
   12. Toolbar

Old Issues. 

    1. For some reason, HOME is a required environment variable.
