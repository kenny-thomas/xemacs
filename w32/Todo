Known Bugs
----------
1.  Mouse drags can cause aborts. I think this is because the timeout
    implementation is broken and can cause the same timeout to go
    off twice (especially during mouse drags?), which makes XEmacs abort. 
    Windows95 doesn't appear to provide any one-shot timers (NT does).
2.  Saving text files doesn't translate LFs back to CRLFs.
3.  XEmacs starts-up with an error or errors.


ToDo
----
1.  w32-make-font-foo in w32/w32-faces.el need to be written.
2.  Calling mouse_[enter|leave]_frame_hook.
3.  CRLF text file handling.
4.  Subprocess and socket support.
5.  Eliminate resizing funnies
6.  Scrollbar
7.  Menubar
8.  Larger color database. Palette handling
9.  Middle mouse button emulation. Dragging off-frame.
10. Images
