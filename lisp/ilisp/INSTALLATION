WELCOME TO ILISP.

FIRST INSTALLATION STEP: UNPACKING AND COMPILING.

SECOND INSTALLATION STEP: DIALECT REQUIREMENTS.

ILISP assumes a minimum of CLtL2 compliance. This requirements
immediately clashes with the problems of some KCL-derivativs,
including GCL.  Here is a list of known problems for several CL
implementations (we do not know whether there are problems with
Scheme's - please let us know).

o All dialects

	Be sure that the variables:

	ilisp-binary-extension
	ilisp-init-binary-extension
	ilisp-binary-command

	Have the appropriate value.  Older versions of ILISP (< 5.8)
	assumed a single CL installation and suggested a change to the
	hook 'ilisp-site-hook' in the 'ilisp.emacs' file.

	This should not be so anymore.


o KCL, AKCL, Ibuki, GCL, and ECL

	- DEFPACKAGE
	  You need to have your system configured with a
	  DEFPACKAGE. You can either generate an image which contains
	  it or you can arrange the init file to load it for you.

	  You can find a DEFPACKAGE in the AI.Repository of CMU.

	- LOOP
	  Most likely the DEFPACKAGE will require a full fledged LOOP.
	  The same instructions apply.


o CMUCL

	Try to set the variables:

	cmulisp-source-directory-regexp
	cmulisp-local-source-directory

	To sensible values.


o Harlequin

	No known extra installation glitches


o Lucid

	No known extra installation glitches


o Allegro

	No known extra installation glitches


o CLISP

	No known extra installation glitches
