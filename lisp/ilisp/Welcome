Welcome to the ILISP Discussion mailing list.

ILISP is a GNU Emacs package for controlling an inferior process
running a lisp dialect.  You can get ILISP by anonymous ftp at
FTP.CS.CMU.EDU in the directory /afs/cs/user/campbell/http/ilisp/.
Also you can find ILISP by getting to the AI.Repository via the WWW.

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html

From there follow: LISP, UTIL, EMACS and finally ILISP

Other archive sites include:

there's no list server programming running, the list is maintained by
hand.

The list has had a very low volume lately, so you may not see messages
for a while after subscribing.

Please note that there is no "bug" list like ilisp-bugs@naggum.no.
The primary list serves the purpose of a general bug fix and
discussion area.
