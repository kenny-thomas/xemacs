The OO-Browser is actually part of an integrated tool framework that we have
developed called InfoDock.  InfoDock provides a modern user interface on top
of Emacs, information management, and powerful software development tools,
all in one package.  Get it via anonymous ftp from host ftp.xemacs.org in
the /pub/infodock directory.

It is a standard part of XEmacs versions 19.12 and above.  The Free
Software Foundation also encourages its use with GNU Emacs.

The OO-Browser is also available as a standalone package via anonymous ftp
across the Internet.  Do not send requests to have it mailed to you since it
won't be.  Instead have another party who has Internet access obtain it for
the both of you.

Here is how to obtain it:

Move to a directory below which you want the 'oobr' directory to
be created.  Unpacking the OO-Browser archive will create this
directory and place all of the files below it.

   cd <LOCAL-LISP-DIR>

Ftp to ftp.xemacs.org  (Internet Host ID = 128.174.252.16):

   prompt> ftp ftp.xemacs.org  (If this doesn't work, try `ftp xemacs.org'.)

Login as 'anonymous' with your own <user-id>@<site-name> as a password.
   
   Name (ftp.xemacs.org): anonymous
   331 Guest login ok, send EMAIL address (e.g. user@host.domain) as password.
   Password:
   230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.

Move to the directory where the OO-Browser is kept:

   ftp> cd /pub/infodock

Set your transfer mode to binary:

   ftp> bin
   200 Type set to I.

Turn off prompting:

   ftp> prompt
   Interactive mode off.

Retrieve the OO-Browser archive and any diff-based patches:

   ftp> mget oobr*

Close the ftp connection:

   ftp> quit
   221 Goodbye.

Unpack the tar archive with:

   gunzip oobr*gz; tar xvf oobr*tar

Apply any patch/diff files with:

   cd oobr; patch < <patch-file>

Read the "BR-README" file for installation directions and pointers to other
documents.
