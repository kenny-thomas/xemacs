Hello,

I've written a new version (4.16) of my html package for the XEmacs 
(lemacs) and the GNU Emacs 19. It is based on the html-mode from Marc
Andreessen. 

With this package it is very easy to write html pages for the World Wide 
Web (WWW). Eg: In most cases the user gets help to construct a specific 
link by examples or by a completition list with possible input strings.

Read the NEWS file to see what's new in this release..

The name of the package is
	hm--html-menus-4.16.tar.gz

You should find it on the following ftp server:
	info.cern.ch in /pub/www/contrib
	sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/apps/editors/emacs/
	ftp.rrzn.uni-hannover.de in /pub/unix/editors/lemacs/contrib
	ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de in /pub/editors/xemacs/contrib

It make take some time, before the package is copied by the ftp admins
from the incoming directories to the above listed directories.

There is also a html documentation about the package. You can find it on:
http://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de:80/data/info/www/tnt/soft/info/www/html-editors/hm--html-menus/overview.html

At the moment it describes the version (4.15), but it will be updated in the 
near future.


The package provides functions to insert the following stuff in html-pages:
1. Anchors:
	html link, info link, gopher link, file link;
	ftp link, news link, mail link, wais (direct) link,
	wais (gateway) link;
	proggate link, local proggate link, general link;
	link target;
2. Frame elements:
	full html frame with html, head, body, title, header and signature
	elements or only the single elements;
	link element;
	html 'created'- and 'changed'- comments;  
	the current date in the title; 
3. Structure elements:
	menu or list item, menu, unordered list, ordered list, directory list;
	description list, description title, description entry;
	new paragraph, new line, horizontal rule, table, table title, 
	table header, table row, table entry;
4. for formatting paragraphs:
	without links, with links, blockquote, listing, abstract;
5. formatting:
	bold, italic, underline, typewriter, strikethru, super and subscript,
	emphasized, strong, 
	definition, keyboard, command, argument, option, variable, instance,
	code, sample,  
	quote, acronym, abbrevation, citation, literature, publication, isbn,
	person, author, editor, credits, copyright,
	footnote, margin,
	html comment;
6. include:
	top aligned image, middle aligned image, bottom aligned image;
7. forms:
	form;
	text, password, isindex, integer, float, date, url, scribble fields; 
	checkbox, radio, reset, image, audio and submit buttons;
	option menus, scrolled lists and option entries;
	textarea;
8. entities:
	most of the special ISO- characters, less, greater and ampersand;

If it makes sense, the functions worked also on selected regions.
I've used the same menu items and the same keystrokes. Therefore, you
don't need to learn different menus or keys for similar functions.

You can choose the popup menus between an expert menu, an novice menu and
the menu from Marc Andreessen interactively.

With the pulldown menu, you can do the following things:
- select the pulldown menu
- remove numeric names
- quotify hrefs
- reload the config files
- load html templates from a template directory (two templates are included
  in the package); templates written in a special template language are
  expanded automatically;
- preview html documents with the netscape
- preview html documents with the xmosaic
- preview html documents with the w3 package for the lemacs and emacs

You can configure the html mode with a special configuration file for
your site and with another file specific for a user.

The html specification is under development and therefore this
package is also under development. So, if you have any ideas to
extend the package, feel free to email them to muenkel@tnt.uni-hannover.de.
