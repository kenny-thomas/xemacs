;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides GNU Emacs major modes for editing C, C++,
;; Objective-C, and Java code.  As of the latest Emacs and XEmacs
;; releases, it is the default package for editing these languages.
;; This package is called "CC Mode", and should be spelled exactly
;; this way.  It supports K&R and ANSI C, ANSI C++, Objective-C, and
;; Java, with a consistent indentation model across all modes.  This
;; indentation model is intuitive and very flexible, so that almost
;; any desired style of indentation can be supported.  Installation,
;; usage, and programming details are contained in an accompanying
;; texinfo manual.

;; CC Mode's immediate ancestors were, c++-mode.el, cplus-md.el, and
;; cplus-md1.el..

;; NOTE: This mode does not perform font-locking (a.k.a syntactic
;; coloring, keyword highlighting, etc.) for any of the supported
;; modes.  Typically this is done by a package called font-lock.el
;; which I do *not* maintain.  You should contact the Emacs
;; maintainers for questions about coloring or highlighting in any
;; language mode.

;; To submit bug reports, type "C-c C-b".  These will be sent to
;; bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu as well as cc-mode-help@python.org,
;; and I'll read about them there (the former is mirrored as the
;; Usenet newsgroup gnu.emacs.bug).  Questions can sent to
;; help-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu (mirrored as gnu.emacs.help) and/or
;; cc-mode-help@python.org.  Please do not send bugs or questions to
;; my personal account.

;; YOU CAN IGNORE ALL BYTE-COMPILER WARNINGS. They are the result of
;; the cross-Emacsen support.  GNU Emacs 19 (from the FSF), GNU XEmacs
;; 19 (formerly Lucid Emacs), and GNU Emacs 18 all do things
;; differently and there's no way to shut the byte-compiler up at the
;; necessary granularity.  Let me say this again: YOU CAN IGNORE ALL
;; BYTE-COMPILER WARNINGS (you'd be surprised at how many people don't
;; follow this advice :-).

;; Many, many thanks go out to all the folks on the beta test list.
;; Without their patience, testing, insight, code contributions, and
;; encouragement CC Mode would be a far inferior package.

;; You can get the latest version of CC Mode, including PostScript
;; documentation and separate individual files from:
;;
;;     http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/

;; Or if you don't have access to the World Wide Web, through
;; anonymous ftp from:

  "A list of features extant in the Emacs you are using.
There are many flavors of Emacs out there, each with different
features supporting those needed by CC Mode.  Here's the current
supported list, along with the values for this variable:

 XEmacs 19:                  (8-bit)
 XEmacs 20:                  (8-bit)
 Emacs 19:                   (1-bit)

Infodock (based on XEmacs) has an additional symbol on this list:
'infodock.")
