           (rolo-edit): Added wrolo-edit-hook, executed after point is
    successfully moved to the record to edit.  These can be used, for
    example, to add and update date entries in address records.
           (rolo-current-date): Added.
	   (rolo-set-date): Added and used as default wrolo-add-hook and

    XEmacs byte compiler bug in some versions.  The bug shows up when
    kotl-mode:center-line is called on the first line of a cell and the
    cell label is centered along with the line (the label should not
    move).

Tue Mar  4 20:45:52 1997  Bob Weiner  <weiner@infodock.com>

* hsite-ex.el (hpath:find-alist): Modified to use `xv' to display xpm

* kotl/kprop-xe.el (kproperty:put): Fixed problem with internal handling
    of text property protocols within newer versions of XEmacs.  The
    `text-prop' symbol can no longer be set to `t'.  It must be set to

    text-properties.

    was displayed using a specialized function.
           (hpath:find-line): Added to handle displaying of all files at

* hsys-w3.el: Renamed entries in this file and added
    action-key-url-function definition in "hyperbole.el", which can be
    used to change the display function used when a URL is activated with
    the Action Key.  Also, loaded this library by default instead of
    requiring that it be set up in "hsite.el".

Fri Nov  3 19:25:24 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@infodock.com>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode): Fixed so re-narrows a formatted koutline

    the 0 cell's attributes before any other attribute data.

    cell when visible-p flag was given.

                (kcell-view:child-p)
                (kcell-view:sibling-p): Added optional visible-p parameter to

    proportional scrolling by default.  Scrollbars are often available
    when non-proportional scrolling is desired.

Mon Oct 30 01:37:31 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@infodock.com>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:copy-to-buffer): Made the default buffer to
    copy to the buffer in the other window of this frame, if any.  Also
    fixed bug that caused more than one tree to be copied if there was no
    successor for the tree but there was a following higher level cell.

* hsys-www.el: Removed this library that encapsulated the old CERN
    command-line WWW browser.  No one would want to use that today.  Use

    number, the line number is used.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:fill-paragraph): Fixed bugs that kept it
    from filling paragraphs where point was not on the first paragraph
    line but the first line did not need filling.

* hui-mini.el (Win/PopRing):
              (Win/YankRing): Changed so they redisplay the Win menu.
    This lets you repeatedly yank or pop window configurations until you reach
    the one you want.

* kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:create): Fixed so if no-fill is in the kcell's
    attribute list, rather than passed in as the `no-fill' argument, its
    value is still used.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:add-cell): Added extra argument so can pass
    in a list of attributes for the cell, as a property list.
                    (kotl-mode:split-cell): Fixed so original cell
    attributes are propagated to the newly created cell.

* kotl/kfile.el (kfile:create): Modified to handle importation of a
    foreign text buffer when kotl-mode calls this function within a
    foreign format buffer.

Sat Oct 28 02:32:12 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@infodock.com>

* hactypes.el (link-to-kcell): 
* kotl/kotl.el (kcell:ref-to-id):

* kotl/kview.el (kview:set-label-separator): Rewrote so properly changes
    the separator in the current view.  Made it interactive and removed
    input argument, kview.  Use local buffer value of kview instead.
    Added key binding for it, {C-c M-l}.
* kotl/kprop-em.el:
  kotl/kprop-xe.el (kproperty:replace-separator): Added, called by above
    function.

    entries.

* kotl/kotl.el (kcell:read-only-attributes): Added, lists cell attributes
    that may not be modified by a user.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:insert-file-contents): Renamed from
    kotl-mode:insert-file.  Now use that name to import a file as a
    sequence of sibling cells, rather than one monolithic cell, bound to
    {C-x i}, overloading the standard insert-file.
                    (kotl-mode:get-cell-attribute): Added.
                    (kotl-mode:set-cell-attribute): Added, bound to {C-c C-i}.

    an existing or non-existing koutline and can take buffer, buffer-name or
    file arguments.
                  (kimport:aug-post-outline): 
	          (kimport:star-outline): Fixed and speeded up.  Code had
    somehow broken over time.
                  (kimport:text): 
                  (kimport:text-cells): Added to import text paragraph as
    cells all at the same level.

    of koutline files so they are read in with the right mode even if they
    do not have a file suffix of .kotl.
                (kfile:read-name): Relaxed to allow files without .kotl suffix.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kfile:write): Fixed bug that failed to restore local
    hook settings after renaming buffer.  This would cause invalid
    koutlines to be written after a rename.
*                   (kotl-mode): Fixed bug that treated a koutline that
    has been read in and formatted for editing as an unformatted koutline.

* hibtypes.el (text-toc):
  hactypes.el (text-toc): Added to use README table of contents as
