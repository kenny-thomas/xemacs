Mailcrypt version 3.4 is now available.

Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
to message encryption with PGP.  (You do use Emacs to handle your mail
and news, right?)

Features: Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting
keys, passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
(including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.

*We* think it's the best interface to these functions anywhere, but
then again, we're biased.

The NEWS file is appended to this message.
