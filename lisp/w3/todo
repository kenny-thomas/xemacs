BUGS:
----
- <br> in <dd> hosed - margins in general tend to be too big sometimes.
- too much space after an ordered list item - can't fix without
  completely screwing up the spacing algorithm.  *sigh*
- tags in <title> elements crap out.  Check out
  http://www.uni-mainz.de/~steffens/html-public/usrguide_3.html#0 for a
  sample.
- Interaction with Emacspeak is inexcusably weak
  - Need option to turn off table rendering and print it out as a
    table that is viewable with emacspeak-table-ui.el
  - Reimplement <label> support for form items
  - Better/more information stored in each hypertext link
  - Better/more information stored in each form entry area
- Need at least bare-bones frames support where you can at least
  convert a frameset into a list of destinations and display those for
  the user.
- <link> handling should keep track of the 'title' attribute of the link
- sometimes images delete a large chunk of the buffer they are in.  Check out 
  http://cs-www.uchicago.edu/ - seems to be the <img alt=" "> stuff.  Ack.
- should use 'editable-field' widget type for 'text' and 'multiline' widgets.
- ebola warnings when using gopher in XEmacs 20.0
- Resetting a form resets the internal structures, but not the buffer
  representation.  This one will be ugly.
- cannot save a page as postscript
- cannot dump an XEmacs w/W3 - attempt to modify read-only object.
  Apparently a problem somewhere in w3-parse, as if it is reloaded
  after dumping, the problem goes away.
- client side imagemaps have to be in the same buffer (actually in the
  smae buffer, _BEFORE_ the usemap directive on an image) - fix to be
  able to use imagemaps in different files, any position, etc, etc.
- filename handling bug in OS/2 - the c:\ stuff confuses it.
- some way of specifying in a stylesheet whether certain text is
  inaudible.  use the 'inaudible text property for this.
- w3-fetch should take its prefix arg in the standard way and it
  should be documented in the doc string
- Should make cache directory private by default.
- When fetching a compressed file with "C-u RET", W3 seems to uncompress
  before saving on disk, but suggests a save file name with the ".gz"
  extension.  It should either not uncompress in this case, or remove the
  ".gz" extension from the suggested save file name.  (My personal
  preference is that it should not uncompress.  Emacs has no trouble
  looking at compressed files and they take up less disk space.)
- w3-complete-link ensures that the input matches one of the links,
  except for case.  If there is a link named "XX", you can enter "xx".
  You will then get the error "Wrong type argument: stringp, nil".
- Sometimes widget keybindings get thrown in the minibuffer map.  Try M-: C-M-i
- We do not like a separate minibuffer frame at all under Emacs

FEATURES:
- font.elc is still not cross-emacsen.  Damn keyword lossage.
- Widget library merging
  - Using {TAB} to move to the next hyperlink moves to the first
    character of the line if the hyperlink button is centered.  In
    such cases, a lot of whitespace can precede the first character of
    the link and although the button can be activated from this
    whitespace, visually it would make much more sense to move to the
    first non-whitespace character within the field.
  - Add support for using real images for checkboxes, etc. in widget library
  - Clean up the image widget, and make it play nice with emacspeak
  - Write a tabcontrol widget and use it for preferences panel
  - Write a font selection widget
  - Write a voice selection widget
  - Write a password entry widget
  - Write a mailcap entry widget
- Custom library merging
  - Add custom support for W3, URL, MM
- Proxy support
  - The URL proxy checking is now able to use a function instead of
    using an alist.  Perhaps have some basic javascript->elisp converter
    so that people can use netscape-style auto-proxy configuration.
  - Provide functions comparable to those provided to netscape
    javascript proxy auto configuration.  See
    http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html
- LaTeX backend
  - Stylesheet support
  - Table support
- Display code
  - Support recommended rendering of <dir> as multi-column
  - Support multi-column somehow
  - Support <dl compact>
  - implement <spacer> from netscape 3.0b5
  - reimplement w3-show-headers
  - Handle math environment using the calc library
  - Better integration with the paresr
  - Better user feedback
  - Better incremental display (page-by-page drawing?)
- People want to see size and last-modified of remote ftp directories.
  Only if ange-ftp or efs start returning valid data for file-attributes.
  Either that, or some integration work needs to happen with dired.  Perhaps
  a w3-dired-minor-mode that rebinds return, button1-3, etc.  hmmmm....
- Write a new major mode for handling CSS style sheets
- Support the <object> tag
- Deal with frames right
- Add back in the 'host' method for url-gateway-method - perhaps steal
  code from GNUS

MAINTENANCE CRAP
