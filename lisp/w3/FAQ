Q: Options menu is ugly under Emacs 19
A: Wait for 19.35 - this is because of a 'feature lack' in easymenu.el

Q: I get an error when starting up:
   Symbol's value as variable is void: widget-mouse-face
A: This usually means you compiled W3 in an emacs that could not find
   the 'custom' package (or found an old version), but are running W3
   in an emacs that find the new one.  This is usually the case if you
   have a recent version of GNUS installed in a non-standard place.

   Make sure that you can load the custom library when compiling
   emacs.  Set the environment variable WIDGETDIR to where your custom
   library lives (ie: ~/lisp/gnus/lisp)
