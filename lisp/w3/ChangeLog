  well as \n

* url-gw.el (url-open-stream): Added in 'telnet' and 'rlogin' methods for

  link completion.  The user can use 'test' to complete to link titled
  'Test'.  Uses try-completion for this, which seems to work since we
  require a match.  Is this the best way to do this?  Other than not being
  case-insensitive at this point?

  updates to text entry fields.
  (w3-revert-form): Everything should be reverted correctly, both in

  (css-parse): Better handling of '@' directives in general
  (css-expand-value): General cleanup, reference the CSS and ACSS specs
  for how/why we are parsing something the way we are.

  type for netscape compatibility.

* w3-display.el (w3-region): New function that parses the HTML in a region
  'in-place', so that things like MIME mailers/gnus readers can show HTML
  inline a lot easier.

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-resurrect-widgets): Fixed case where a widget goes
  all the way to point-max and next-single-property-change will return
  nil.  Would pass bad args to delete-region.
  (w3-form-summarize-field): Moved some of the smarts about summarizing W3
  widgets from w3-speak into the core forms code.

  the :filter entries under XEmacs do.  This will make things much easier
  in the future in not duplicating crufty menu-construction code once for
  XEmacs menu-structs and once for Emacs keymaps.

* w3-menu.el (w3-menu-html-links-constructor): Now works with the Emacs 19

* url-file.el (url-format-directory): Removed url-forms-based-ftp option -
  didn't really work anyway.

Sun Dec 29 00:07:39 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-add-element): Only insert stubs of the right length
  for a for element, and do munging of that text into the actual widgets
  later.  This saves us a lot of grief and heartache when handling things
  like radio buttons that span table elements because the markers have
  become completely insane by the time the next widget is ready to be
  created.

Sat Dec 28 17:24:08 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-display.el (w3-display-table): Don't crap out on invalid tables where
  table-dimensions tells us we have a 0 column or 0 row table.

* w3-widget.el (widget-image-value-create): Use :action instead of :notify
  for widget-image-callback - hyperlinked images under Emacs 19 should
  work again.

Thu Dec 26 18:26:25 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3.el (w3-widget-forward): Use this instead of widget-forward.

* Emacs-W3 3.0.41 released

* url-parse.el (url-generic-parse-url): bind inhibit-read-only to 't' in
  url parsing buffers, to avoid 'attempt to modify read-only text'
  problems when the string passed to url-generic-parse-url has the
  read-only text property set.

* w3-e19.el (w3-setup-version-specifics): popup menus should work in
  Emacs19 again.

* css.el (css-expand-value): For margin and padding, make sure we _always_
  convert into a valid length spec.  Setting a 'margin' or 'padding'
  property group instead of individual margin-* or padding-* values would
  cause the display engine to crap out.
  (css-get): Fixed generic class-only lookups (.foo, etc)

* w3-display.el (w3-display-handle-list-type): Tweaks to list indentation

  w3-open-local to avoid having illegal URLs like file:/~/test.html

* w3-widget.el (widget-image-value-create): fixed new problem with client
  side imagemaps.  Should really work this time.

* w3.el (w3-map-links): w3-map-links and hence w3-complete-link will now
  find images that are also hyperlinks.

Mon Dec 23 22:28:58 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs-W3 3.0.40 released

* w3-menu.el (w3-menu-go-menu): Added 'navigate' submenu to hold the

  from, and url-current-object is null, set it to the object returned by
  parsing url-view-url.

* url-http.el (url-create-mime-request): Send the right information in the
  'Host' header field when going through a proxy.
  (url-setup-reload-timer): Emacs 19 doesn't deal well with 0-length
  timeouts, so protect against trying to create one when dealing with the
  refresh header.

* w3-parse.el: Removed lots of crap for the old display engine - shouldn't
  cons up as much garbage as before.  Now it will just cons up garbage
  that we actually need.

Tue Dec 17 07:10:47 1996  William Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* css.el (css-properties): New property type 'string-list' for font-family

* w3.el (w3-find-default-stylesheets): Make sure to look in
  data-directory/../../w3 for stylesheets

Tue Dec 17 06:07:08 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs-W3 3.0.38 released.

  prettier.

* w3-display.el (w3-display-node): EVIL hack to make the first item in a

  right-justification will take effect.

Sat Dec 14 10:24:13 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

Fri Dec 13 09:47:40 1996  William Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-style.el (w3-display-stylesheet): Fixed problem where
  w3-display-stylesheet would override the buffer css-display was showing
  the stylesheet in.  Duhh.

  mule
  (mule-sysdep-version): Ditto.

Fri Dec 13 06:25:45 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* css.el (css-get): Removed bogus recursive call to css-get, and moved the
  guts of css-get out into its own fuction, which is in turn inlined into
  css-get.  Might even make things faster.  At the least, I expect it to
  get rid of the 'takes two makes to make w3-display.elc' problem some
  people have been seeing.

* w3-display.el (w3-display-handle-list-type): Fixed stupid problem with
  margin handling where list-item display items were always flush-left

Fri Dec 13 02:51:24 1996  Greg Stark  <gsstark@mit.edu>
* w3-display.el (w3-display-line-break): correct right justification code
