* css.el (css-split-font-shorthand): Make sure that the subelements of the
  'font' shorthand property get run through the property value-expansion
  routines before getting returned.  This royally screwed up font-family,
  font-weight, and friends.
  (css-expand-color):  Now recognizes 'transparent' and 'none' as special
  color names.
  (css-expand-value): When dealing with color-shorthand, make sure
  everything gets run through the value-expansion routines as well.  Ack.

* w3-elisp.el (w3-elisp-safe-function): You can now supply a validation
  function for the arguments of a script-enabled function, its no longer a
  binary operation on just the function name.  You can also give it a
  variable name, and the value of that variable at the time of execution
  is what controls whether it is safe or not.

* w3.el (w3-download-url): Finally fixed bug where w3-download-url would
  not save in the correct directory if you just accepted the default
  pathname it offered.

* url-cache.el (url-cache-ignored-protocols): New variable controlling
  what protocols we should never cache to disk.
  (url-cache-cachable-p): use it.

* w3.txi: Updated all nodes and menus, a few stylistic changes

  property-lists.  Also added function, lambda, point, and list accessors
  (member, memq, assoc)

* w3-display.el (w3-display-node): Bind widget-push-button-gui to nil in
  w3-display-node so that images don't run into the
  visible-portion-of-buffer-is-not-modifiable-bug.  Ick.

* w3-elisp.el: Don't allow access to 'set'-type text-property functions
  from scripts.

Tue Feb 18 15:11:08 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs-W3 3.0.61 released

* w3.txi (Supported URLs): added sections on each protocol supported -
  needs lots of fleshing out.

  you can have something like info:w3.info#Getting%20Started

* url.el (url-do-setup): Removed secure-http (SHTTP) handler - who the
  hell cares anymore, it lost.

* w3-display.el (w3-display-node): Correctly calculates right margin as
  documented (from window-width and right-margin)

* w3.el: Removed w3-batch-fetch

(w3-do-scripting): New variable to control whether to do _any_ scripting
or not.

* The URL package now stores the current parsed URL object instead of 5 or
  6 separate variables.

  apparently nobody was using it.

  summarizer.

Tue Feb 18 06:13:03 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-display.el (w3-finish-drawing): Moved #blah target finding in here,
  where it belongs.

* w3-vars.el (w3-mode-map): Added binding for raw '\t' instead of relying
  on [tab].  Apparently this keysym isn't aliased under Emacs 19 on a
  TTY.

Mon Feb 17 15:10:38 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-elisp.el: Interface to Emacs-Lisp for safe scripting.

* w3-display.el (w3-handle-string-content): Now adds a text property that
  contains w3-display-open-element-stack, so that from anywhere in the
  buffer you can find out where you are in the parse tree.

* default.css (input): ome default stylesheet updates for input fields on
  TTYs

Sun Feb 16 09:01:18 1997  Shuji Narazaki <narazaki@InetQ.or.jp>

* Synch'd up to widget 1.38

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-resurrect-widgets): For now, don't use the nice new

(w3-popup-menu-on-mouse-3): New variable to control whether W3 should
  override mouse-3 or not.

  multiple times again.

Wed Feb 12 06:26:55 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-keymap): When binding widget-end-of-line, make sure
  that we do not overwrite Emacspeak's prefix-key.  Now does a
  where-is-internal to find the correct binding in global-map to
  override.

* w3-display.el (w3-display-node): bind :emacspeak-help to 'w3-widget-echo
  in all the hypertext links.

* w3-vars.el (w3-mode-map): New binding for \M-\t - this _should_ have
  been taken care of by the [(meta tab)] definition, but evidently it
  doesn't.  *sigh*

Tue Feb 11 07:33:50 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-create-option-list): Specify :menu-tag-get so that
  keyboard-based-completion doesn't get confused by the fact that some
  items will have spaces slapped in at the end.

* ssl.el (ssl-program-arguments): New variable - a list of command line
  switches to send to the SSL program in a subprocess, before the hostname
  and port number.
  (open-ssl-stream): Use it.

* w3-xemac.el (w3-setup-version-specifics): Workaround for users of XEmacs
  19.14 or 20.0 with the bad bad bad lossage with text properties that
  have null values.  This  bug is fixed in XEmacs 19.15, and will be in
  20.1 as well.  This bug would cause you to get errors like:
	internal error: no text-prop <#extent ....> start-open

* w3.el (w3-widget-button-click): Deal with new image capabilities of the
  widget checkbox/radio-button stuff.

* Synch'ed up to widget 1.31

* Emacs-W3 3.0.57 released

* url-file.el (url-dired-minor-mode): New minor mode that overrides a few
  of direds keybindings to use Emacs-W3 instead of straight find-file.
  (url-format-directory): Now just uses dired to display directory
  listings, much more powerful than the old way.  Can copy files, act on
  multiple files, you all know the drill.

* w3.txi: Added more chapters, reorg of others.

* w3-display.el (w3-maybe-start-image-download): Fixed handling of bad
  images in the cache again.  Duh.
  No longer log to the warnings buffer if we fail to load an image.  Just
  use message - much less intrusive.  We just usually don't care that much
  about failed image loads.

* url-gw.el (url-open-stream): fixed typo - was calling old
  url-nslookup-host instead of url-gateway-nslookup-host

* w3.el (w3-insert-formatted-url): Now inserts markup in lowercase.

Sat Feb  8 13:54:43 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  summarization of radio buttons
  Fixed typo in specifying summarizer for hidden form fields.
  (w3-form-keymap): Bind C-a and C-e by default.

* w3-widget.el (widget-image-value-create): When using emacspeak, show
  client side imagemaps as a table.  Need a more general solution for
  this, but this makes us nicer than IE again. :)

* Updated to widget 1.30

Fri Feb  7 16:49:55 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-display.el (w3-handle-string-content): Make sure faces text
  properties are closed, so that things don't bleed over.
  (w3-fixup-eol-faces): New function for Emacs 19 that removes face
  information at newlines, so that underlining will not extend from the
  end of a line to the window edges - very ugly.

* w3-menu.el (w3-menu-initialize-w3-mode-menu-map): Don't support 'emacs
  in w3-use-menus under Emacs in Windows 95/NT.

* w3-display.el (w3-finalize-image-download): Deal with bad images better.
  (w3-finish-drawing): Better protection of putting images in.

  an error if you fail to connect to a site.  This is for image loadings
  that fail for some reason or another.

* css.el (css-expand-length): better handling of float values and 'ex'
  unit type.

* font.el (x-font-create-object): Unconditionally make case-fold-search
  non-nil so that we don't lose big-time.  This was the cause of the very
  weird font-spatial-to-canonical lossage under XEmacs with font sizes of
  something like '+12pt'

* w3.el (w3-view-this-url): Use widget-echo-help if we didn't find a URL
  under point.

Fri Feb  7 15:22:25 1997  Charles Levert <charles@comm.polymtl.ca>

* w3-widget.el (widget-image-notify): Bad data being fed to w3-fetch if a
  client-side imagemap had an alt attribute (but only if the <map> came
  _after_ the use.

Fri Feb  7 15:22:25 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-parse.el (w3-parse-buffer): Parser didn't allow for the fact that
  TAGC is optional on end-tags as well as on start-tags (i.e. "<b<i>
  bold-italic</i</b>" is legal).

Fri Feb  7 06:28:37 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-keymap): Now inherits from widget-keymap, with a
  few exceptions.

* url.el (url-uncompress): This function now no longer looks at the file
  extension to determine a compression/encoding method.  This is so that
  doing searches on `foo.tar.gz' will not bogusly cause the decompression
  steps to run.  Ick!

* url-file.el (url-insert-possibly-compressed-file): This function no
  longer atempts to decompress the file after loading it in.  Instead, it
  sets an appropriate content-transfer-encoding header based on the
  filename, so that this will allow url-uncompress to work correctly on the
  buffer.

Thu Feb  6 06:24:26 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  use the old-style interaction with form fields instead of the 'type
  directly into the buffer' method
  (w3-form-determine-size): Use it.
  (w3-form-create-integer): Use it.
  (w3-form-create-float): Use it.
  (w3-form-create-text): Use it.

* w3-display.el (w3-size-of-tree): Removed some warnings
(w3-display-table-dimensions): ditto

* Updated to widget 1.26

  Everything is underlined by default except submit/reset/image/button
  fields, so that they are a little easier to spot.

* w3-parse.el (w3-parse-buffer): Now slaps pseudo-elements into input
  fields so that stylesheets can access them.

* Emacs-W3 3.0.55 released

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-determine-size): Fixed _STUPID_ problem where
  option lists would lose everything but the first option in them.  I'm a
  dumbass.  Sort modifies its list parameter! ICK ICK ICK.

* url.el (url-after-change-function): Show prettier status messages.
  Sizes are converted to bytes, k, or M, depending on how big the file
  is.

* w3.txi: Lots of documentation changes - volunteers welcome.

* Removed personal annotation support, since it wasn't shown with the new
  display engine, it needs to be rethought, and nobody had complained in
  the entire beta cycle.

* w3.el (w3-history-find-url-internal): Redid the history mechanism.
  Toolbar and menu entries are now grayed out appropriately.

* url-http.el (url-create-mime-request): Fixed cookie support if not going

Tue Jan 28 06:22:08 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* font.el (x-font-create-name): Never take font size into account under
  Emacs - too much chance of totally screwing up the users leading by
  choosing a bigger font than their default.  This sucks.  But I can't
  find a better solution.

* w3.el: w3-mode now turns on truncate-lines by default.

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-create-image): Better image input type support.

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-create-password): Now uses real password entry

  comes with Emacs-W3 for this, otherwise the info won't be hidden
  correctly.
  (w3-form-add-element): Deal with hidden text areas better when they are
  in forms

  newlines/carriage returns. More fixes for that bastardized microsoft
  home page.

* url-http.el (url-create-mime-request): Make sure that we retrieve the

  idiotic microsoft home page that sends out set-cookie headers that look
  like MC1=ID=abc, and expects two cookies MC1='' and ID='abc'  *sigh*

  with them.  Will be useful when we start allowing scripting.
  (w3-form-create-custom): Rudimentary patches to allow embedding 'custom'
  widgets into the buffer.  Interesting.

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-determine-size): New function to calculate how big

  username and password in the URL would downcase the username and
  password as well as the hostname.

  for theoretically 'naked' input fields that we want to try and handle as
  best we can anyway.

* w3-forms.el: summarizer functions now take the widget as an extra
  parameter.

  the .info or .dvi file yourself.

  instead of just plain old 'mail'.

* url-misc.el (url-generic-emulator-loader): Consolidated the tn3270,
  telnet, and rlogin URL loaders into one smarter function

* url.el: Made cookie and auth modules autoloaded, removed some old autoloads

  link completion.  The user can use 'test' to complete to link titled

  require a match.  Is this the best way to do this?  Other than not being
  case-insensitive at this point?

  updates to text entry fields.
  (w3-revert-form): Everything should be reverted correctly, both in

  'recommendation' level CSS specification.
  (css-handle-import): much better handling of @import
  (css-parse): Better handling of '@' directives in general
  (css-expand-value): General cleanup, reference the CSS and ACSS specs
  for how/why we are parsing something the way we are.

  type for netscape compatibility.

* w3-display.el (w3-region): New function that parses the HTML in a region
  'in-place', so that things like MIME mailers/gnus readers can show HTML
  inline a lot easier.

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-resurrect-widgets): Fixed case where a widget goes
  all the way to point-max and next-single-property-change will return
  nil.  Would pass bad args to delete-region.
  (w3-form-summarize-field): Moved some of the smarts about summarizing W3

  the :filter entries under XEmacs do.  This will make things much easier
  in the future in not duplicating crufty menu-construction code once for
  XEmacs menu-structs and once for Emacs keymaps.

* w3-menu.el (w3-menu-html-links-constructor): Now works with the Emacs 19

* url-file.el (url-format-directory): Removed url-forms-based-ftp option -
  didn't really work anyway.

Sun Dec 29 00:07:39 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-add-element): Only insert stubs of the right length
  for a for element, and do munging of that text into the actual widgets
  later.  This saves us a lot of grief and heartache when handling things
  like radio buttons that span table elements because the markers have
  become completely insane by the time the next widget is ready to be
  created.

Sat Dec 28 17:24:08 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-display.el (w3-display-table): Don't crap out on invalid tables where
  table-dimensions tells us we have a 0 column or 0 row table.

* w3-widget.el (widget-image-value-create): Use :action instead of :notify
  for widget-image-callback - hyperlinked images under Emacs 19 should
  work again.

* Emacs-W3 3.0.41 released

* url-parse.el (url-generic-parse-url): bind inhibit-read-only to 't' in
  url parsing buffers, to avoid 'attempt to modify read-only text'

  read-only text property set.

  Emacs19 again.

* css.el (css-expand-value): For margin and padding, make sure we _always_

  property group instead of individual margin-* or padding-* values would
  cause the display engine to crap out.
  (css-get): Fixed generic class-only lookups (.foo, etc)

* w3-display.el (w3-display-handle-list-type): Tweaks to list indentation

  side imagemaps.  Should really work this time.

  parsing url-view-url.

  'Host' header field when going through a proxy.

  timeouts, so protect against trying to create one when dealing with the
  refresh header.

* w3-parse.el: Removed lots of crap for the old display engine - shouldn't
  cons up as much garbage as before.  Now it will just cons up garbage
  that we actually need.

* css.el (css-properties): New property type 'string-list' for font-family

* w3-style.el (w3-display-stylesheet): Fixed problem where

* css.el (css-get): Removed bogus recursive call to css-get, and moved the
  guts of css-get out into its own fuction, which is in turn inlined into
  css-get.  Might even make things faster.  At the least, I expect it to
  get rid of the 'takes two makes to make w3-display.elc' problem some
  people have been seeing.

* w3-display.el (w3-display-handle-list-type): Fixed stupid problem with
  margin handling where list-item display items were always flush-left

* w3.el (w3-sentinel): hack around bug that bit w3-preview-this-buffer 
                       but I don't know what the right thing for Mule.

* docomp.el: increase max-specpdl-size so it can compile w3-display

* url.el (url-sentinel): avoid save-excursion around switch-buffer 

* w3-display (w3-display-line-break): if we're in nowrap mode but the
  region doesn't end on a newline insert an extra newline, otherwise <br>
  gets ignored inside a <pre> or nowrap environment. 
  Also protect against fill-column less than the length of fill-prefix. 
  Also avoid infloop in right justification, and
  fix bug that caused right justification to never be executed.

* w3-display (table-cut table-dimensions w3-display-table): 
  lots of new code to handle rowspan and autolayout.

* (w3-display-fix-widgets): be more agressive adjust even markers that have
  buffers and adjust parent markers.

  Don't insert insert-before on <a> tags before the class is adjusted
  Don't insert more than one class into an <a> tag when we adjust it. 
  Protect against a negative fill-column when drawing <hr>s
  Set adaptive-fill-mode (what's filladapt-mode?)

  consequences this has but it seems to have the desired effect of
  handling table cells whose first tag is a <font> without discarding the
  implied <p> tag.

  (some people seem to think you can put attributes in end tags)

  creation.

  stylesheet, not vice versa.
  (w3-display-node) Fixed stupid mistake in 'link' handling where
  stylesheets were ignored.

  Modified some of the css properties to not be inherited - let
  w3-display figure it out on its own - quicker this way.  Saves a few

oblique and italic versions of a font if italic is set.
