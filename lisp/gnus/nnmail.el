(defvar nnmail-split-methods
  '(("mail.misc" ""))
  "*Incoming mail will be split according to this variable.

If you'd like, for instance, one mail group for mail from the
\"4ad-l\" mailing list, one group for junk mail and one for everything
else, you could do something like this:

 (setq nnmail-split-methods
       '((\"mail.4ad\" \"From:.*4ad\")
         (\"mail.junk\" \"From:.*Lars\\\\|Subject:.*buy\")
         (\"mail.misc\" \"\")))

As you can see, this variable is a list of lists, where the first
element in each \"rule\" is the name of the group (which, by the way,
does not have to be called anything beginning with \"mail\",
\"yonka.zow\" is a fine, fine name), and the second is a regexp that
nnmail will try to match on the header to find a fit.

The second element can also be a function.  In that case, it will be
called narrowed to the headers with the first element of the rule as
the argument.  It should return a non-nil value if it thinks that the
mail belongs in that group.

The last element should always have \"\" as the regexp.

This variable can also have a function as its value.")

;; Suggested by Erik Selberg <speed@cs.washington.edu>.
(defvar nnmail-crosspost t

(defvar nnmail-use-long-file-names nil
  "*If non-nil the mail backends will use long file and directory names.
If nil, groups like \"mail.misc\" will end up in directories like
\"mail/misc/\".")

(defvar nnmail-expiry-wait 7
  "*Expirable articles that are older than this will be expired.
This variable can either be a number (which will be interpreted as a
number of days) -- this doesn't have to be an integer.  This variable
can also be `immediate' and `never'.")

(defvar nnmail-expiry-wait-function nil
  "*Variable that holds function to specify how old articles should be before they are expired.
  The function will be called with the name of the group that the
expiry is to be performed in, and it should return an integer that
says how many days an article can be stored before it is considered
\"old\".  It can also return the values `never' and `immediate'.

Eg.:

(setq nnmail-expiry-wait-function

The incoming mail is moved from `nnmail-spool-file' (which normally is
something like \"/usr/spool/mail/$user\") to the user's home
directory. This hook is called after the incoming mail box has been
emptied, and can be used to call any mail box programs you have
running (\"xwatch\", etc.)

Eg.

\(add-hook 'nnmail-read-incoming-hook 
	   (lambda () 
	     (start-process \"mailsend\" nil 
			    \"/local/bin/mailsend\" \"read\" \"mbox\")))

If you have xwatch running, this will alert it that mail has been
read.  

If you use `display-time', you could use something like this:

\(add-hook 'nnmail-read-incoming-hook

(defvar nnmail-split-fancy "mail.misc"
  "*Incoming mail can be split according to this fancy variable.
To enable this, set `nnmail-split-methods' to `nnmail-split-fancy'.

The format is this variable is SPLIT, where SPLIT can be one of
the following:

GROUP: Mail will be stored in GROUP (a string).

\(FIELD VALUE SPLIT): If the message field FIELD (a regexp) contains
  VALUE (a regexp), store the messages as specified by SPLIT.

\(| SPLIT...): Process each SPLIT expression until one of them matches.
  A SPLIT expression is said to match if it will cause the mail
  message to be stored in one or more groups.  

\(& SPLIT...): Process each SPLIT expression.

FIELD must match a complete field name.  VALUE must match a complete
word according to the `nnmail-split-fancy-syntax-table' syntax table.
You can use .* in the regexps to match partial field names or words.

FIELD and VALUE can also be lisp symbols, in that case they are expanded
as specified in `nnmail-split-abbrev-alist'.

Example:

\(setq nnmail-split-methods 'nnmail-split-fancy
      nnmail-split-fancy

and `delete', which means that nnmail will delete duplicated mails.
