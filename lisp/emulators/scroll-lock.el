;; Commentary
;;    This mode allows multiple buffers to be 'locked' so that scrolling
;;    up or down lines in any buffer causes all the buffers to mirror
;;    the scrolling.  It hooks into the post-command-hook to check for
;;    potential scrolling commands and if we're locked, mirrors them in all
;;    windows.	This allows us to grab line-at-a-time scrolling as well as
;;    screen-at-a-time scrolling, and doesn't remap any of the keyboard
;;    commands to do it.

;; This minor mode is normally autoloaded from the scroll-lock package.
;; You can disable autoloading of this package by placing
;; (setq crisp-load-scroll-lock nil) in your .emacs before loading
;; the crisp package.  If you want to use this package by itself,
;; you can enable it by placing the following in your .emacs:

;; (require 'scroll-lock)

;; In the first (autoloaded) case, meta-f1 is bound to the command to
;; toggle the scroll-lock mode.  In the second (non-autoloaded) case,
;; you can enable and disable it with the 'scroll-lock-mode' command.
