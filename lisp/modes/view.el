;;; Synched up with: FSF 19.34.

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the `view' minor mode documented in the Emacs
;; user's manual.

;; XEmacs: We don't autoload this because we use `view-less' instead.
;; #### I junked the old version and replaced it with FSF's latest version.
;; Perhaps something needs integrating into view-less.

;;; Code:

;; XEmacs (to try to forestall complaints).

default to \"scroll size\" lines (initially size of window).
Search commands default to a repeat count of one.

C-v or Space	scroll forward lines.
M-v or DEL	scroll backward lines.
CR or LF	scroll forward one line (backward with prefix argument).
z		like Space except set number of lines for further
		   scrolling commands to scroll by.
C-u and Digits	provide prefix arguments.  `-' denotes negative argument.
=		prints the current line number.
g		goes to line given by prefix argument.
/ or M-C-s	searches forward for regular expression
\\ or M-C-r	searches backward for regular expression.
n		searches forward for last regular expression.
p		searches backward for last regular expression.
C-@ or .	set the mark.
x		exchanges point and mark.
C-s or s	do forward incremental search.
C-r or r	do reverse incremental search.
@ or '		return to mark and pops mark ring.
		  Mark ring is pushed at start of every
		  successful search and when jump to line to occurs.
		  The mark is set on jump to buffer start or end.
? or h		provide help message (list of commands).
\\[help-command]		provides help (list of commands or description of a command).

C-p		moves upward lines vertically.
