(autoload 'quail-use-package "quail" "\
Start using Quail package PACKAGE-NAME.
The remaining arguments are libraries to be loaded before using the package." nil nil)

(autoload 'quail-define-package "quail" "\
Define NAME as a new Quail package for input LANGUAGE.
TITLE is a string to be displayed at mode-line to indicate this package.
Optional arguments are GUIDANCE, DOCSTRING, TRANLSATION-KEYS,
 FORGET-LAST-SELECTION, DETERMINISTIC, KBD-TRANSLATE, SHOW-LAYOUT,
 CREATE-DECODE-MAP, MAXIMUM-SHORTEST, OVERLAY-PLIST,
 UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION, CONVERSION-KEYS and SIMPLE.

GUIDANCE specifies how a guidance string is shown in echo area.
If it is t, list of all possible translations for the current key is shown
 with the currently selected translation being highlighted.
If it is an alist, the element has the form (CHAR . STRING).  Each character
 in the current key is searched in the list and the corresponding string is
 shown.
If it is nil, the current key is shown.

DOCSTRING is the documentation string of this package.

TRANSLATION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while translation
region is active.  It is an alist of single key character vs. corresponding
command to be called.

FORGET-LAST-SELECTION non-nil means a selected translation is not kept
for the future to translate the same key.  If this flag is nil, a
translation selected for a key is remembered so that it can be the
first candidate when the same key is entered later.

DETERMINISTIC non-nil means the first candidate of translation is
selected automatically without allowing users to select another
translation for a key.  In this case, unselected translations are of
no use for an interactive use of Quail but can be used by some other
programs.  If this flag is non-nil, FORGET-LAST-SELECTION is also set
to t.

KBD-TRANSLATE non-nil means input characters are translated from a
user's keyboard layout to the standard keyboard layout.  See the
documentation of `quail-keyboard-layout' and
`quail-keyboard-layout-standard' for more detail.

SHOW-LAYOUT non-nil means the `quail-help' command should show
the user's keyboard layout visually with translated characters.
If KBD-TRANSLATE is set, it is desirable to set also this flag unless
this package defines no translations for single character keys.

CREATE-DECODE-MAP non-nil means decode map is also created.  A decode
map is an alist of translations and corresponding original keys.
Although this map is not used by Quail itself, it can be used by some
other programs.  For instance, Vietnamese supporting needs this map to
convert Vietnamese text to VIQR format which uses only ASCII
characters to represent Vietnamese characters.

MAXIMUM-SHORTEST non-nil means break key sequence to get maximum
length of the shortest sequence.  When we don't have a translation of
key \"..ABCD\" but have translations of \"..AB\" and \"CD..\", break
the key at \"..AB\" and start translation of \"CD..\".  Hangul
packages, for instance, use this facility.  If this flag is nil, we
break the key just at \"..ABC\" and start translation of \"D..\".

OVERLAY-PLIST if non-nil is a property list put on an overlay which
covers Quail translation region.

UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION if non-nil is a function to call to update
the current translation region accoding to a new translation data.  By
default, a tranlated text or a user's key sequence (if no transltion
for it) is inserted.

CONVERSION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while
conversion region is active.  It is an alist of single key character
vs. corresponding command to be called.

If SIMPLE is non-nil, then we do not alter the meanings of
commands such as C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p and TAB; they are treated as
non-Quail commands." nil nil)

(autoload 'quail-set-keyboard-layout "quail" "\
Set the current keyboard layout to the same as keyboard KBD-TYPE.

Since some Quail packages depends on a physical layout of keys (not
characters generated by them), those are created by assuming the
standard layout defined in `quail-keyboard-layout-standard'.  This
function tells Quail system the layout of your keyboard so that what
you type is correctly handled." t nil)

(autoload 'quail-define-rules "quail" "\
Define translation rules of the current Quail package.
Each argument is a list of KEY and TRANSLATION.
KEY is a string meaning a sequence of keystrokes to be translated.
TRANSLATION is a character, a string, a vector, a Quail map, or a function.
It it is a character, it is the sole translation of KEY.
If it is a string, each character is a candidate for the translation.
If it is a vector, each element (string or character) is a candidate
  for the translation.
In these cases, a key specific Quail map is generated and assigned to KEY.

If TRANSLATION is a Quail map or a function symbol which returns a Quail map,
 it is used to handle KEY." nil 'macro)

(autoload 'quail-install-map "quail" "\
Install the Quail map MAP in the current Quail package.
The installed map can be referred by the function `quail-map'." nil nil)

(autoload 'quail-defrule "quail" "\
Add one translation rule, KEY to TRANSLATION, in the current Quail package.
KEY is a string meaning a sequence of keystrokes to be translated.
TRANSLATION is a character, a string, a vector, a Quail map,
 a function, or a cons.
It it is a character, it is the sole translation of KEY.
If it is a string, each character is a candidate for the translation.
If it is a vector, each element (string or character) is a candidate
 for the translation.
If it is a cons, the car is one of the above and the cdr is a function
 to call when translating KEY (the return value is assigned to the
 variable `quail-current-data').  If the cdr part is not a function,
 the value itself is assigned to `quail-current-data'.
In these cases, a key specific Quail map is generated and assigned to KEY.

If TRANSLATION is a Quail map or a function symbol which returns a Quail map,
 it is used to handle KEY.
Optional argument NAME, if specified, says which Quail package
to define this translation rule in.  The default is to define it in the
current Quail package." nil nil)
