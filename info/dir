This is the file .../info/dir, which contains the topmost node of the Info
hierarchy.  The first time you invoke Info you start off looking at that node,
which is (dir)Top.

Rather than adding new nodes to this directory (and this file) it is a better
idea to put them in a site-local directory, and then configure info to search
in that directory as well.  That way, you won't have to re-edit this file when
a new release of the editor comes out.

For example, you could add this code to .../lisp/site-start.el, which is
loaded before ~/.emacs each time the editor starts up:

  ;; find local info nodes
  (setq Info-default-directory-list
        (append Info-default-directory-list '("/private/info/")))

Then, when you enter info, the contents of the file "/private/info/localdir"
will be appended to the contents of this file (where the "* Locals:" line is.)
The "localdir" file should simply contain lines like in this file, listing the
names of the info files in its directory.


File: dir	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree
