	   XEmacs availability information.  Last Modified: 18-Jul-99.

XEmacs is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.xemacs.org (207.96.122.8)
in the directory /pub/xemacs/.

ftp.xemacs.org is the primary distribution point, but you may find
copies of it at other sites as well.  Please see the file FTP for mirrors.

The most up-to-date list of distribution sites can always be found on
the XEmacs WWW page, http://www.xemacs.org/.  Try to pick a site
that is networkologically close to you.  If you know of other mirrors
of the XEmacs archives, please send us mail and we will list them here
as well.

There are mailing lists and newsgroups specifically for discussing and
reporting bugs in XEmacs; see the file MAILINGLISTS in this directory.
