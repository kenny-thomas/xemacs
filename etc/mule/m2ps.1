.SH DESCRIPTION
.I m2ps
runs as a filter and converts a text encoded in Mule
internal code (called *internal*) to a PostScript program to
print it.  To handle a text not coded in *internal*, you
have to convert the code to *internal* at first.  You can
use
.I coco
for the code conversion.  You can also use
.I any2ps
to do all the job (code conversion and PostScript generation).

.SH FONT SPECIFICATION
.I m2ps
search for BDF files according to a pathlist (list of
comma-separeated directory) and filenames described in file
CHARSETS.  Each line of this file contains information about
one character set.  The line has 7 to 9 columns each
separated by ':'.  The columns are: LEADING-CHAR, BYTES,
COLUMNS, TYPE, GRAPHIC, FINAL-CHAR, DIRECTION, DOCUMENT,
BDF-FILE, and ENCODING.  By modifying this file, you can
specify different BDF files.  You don't have to specify
ENCODING for 2-byte character sets such as Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean (as for Big5, you should specify 1 for
ETen and 2 for HKU).
