(ding) Gnus Reference Card
--------------------------
Vladimir Alexiev <vladimir@cs.ualberta.ca>
Suggestions and corrections are welcome.

This directory contains reference materials for the Emacs newsreader Gnus. 
Three versions of the reference material are provided:
 - 16-page booklet (\small font)
 - 5-page 2-column reference card (\footnotesize font which is quite small)
 - 1-page 2-column quick refcard (\scriptsize font which is even smaller)
The first two contain all Gnus commands; the last contains only the
most-often used commands. 
 The booklet is provided for single- and double-sided printers, in paper
formats Letter and A4. The other two cards can be printed on both Letter
and A4 printers.

The following files are available:
  bk-lt-d.ps.gz   booklet, Letter paper, double-sided
  bk-lt-s1.ps.gz  booklet, Letter paper, single-sided, first run
  bk-lt-s2.ps.gz  booklet, Letter paper, single-sided, second run
  bk-a4-d.ps.gz   booklet, A4 paper, double-sided
  bk-a4-s1.ps.gz  booklet, A4 paper, single-sided, first run
  bk-a4-s2.ps.gz  booklet, A4 paper, single-sided, second run
  refcard.ps.gz   reference card
  quickref.ps.gz  quick refcard

To produce the booklet:
1) Print the booklet.
 a) If you have a double-sided printer, 
    - just print bk-??-d.ps
 b) If you have a single-sided printer, things are more complicated
    - leave only one paper tray in your printer
    - print bk-??-s1.ps
    - reload the resulting 4-sheet stack back into the printer. Don't
      rearrange the stack, just turn it upside down.
    - print bk-??-s2.ps
2) **Important** Arrange the printed stack in the correct order.
   The pages are numbered, so you can't make a mistake.
3) Fold the booklet in two and staple it in the middle. Enjoy!
