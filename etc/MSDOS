XEmacs does not work under MSDOS.  If you would be interested in porting
XEmacs to MSDOS, please contact Steve Baur <steve@altair.xemacs.org>.

As of 20.1 the old Emacs files have been removed from the XEmacs
distribution.  Interested parties should probably grab updated versions
from a current Emacs distribution.
