This directory contains some mu-law encoded SunOS 4.1 sound files.  

You can only play sound files if you are running on display 0 of the
console of a machine with native sound support or running a NetAudio
server and XEmacs has the necessary sound support compiled in.

You can use these sounds to replace the default beep.  See the
documentation of the `sound-alist' variable, and the functions
`load-default-sounds' and `load-sound-file' from lisp/prim/sound.el.
