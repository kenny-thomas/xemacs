                             Goats: (Capra hircus)

     [INLINE] The goat, along with sheep, were among the earliest
     domesticated animals. Goat remains have been found at
     archaeological sites in western Asia, such as Jericho, Choga, Mami,
     Djeitun and Cayonu, which allows domestication of the goats to be
     dated at between 6000 and 7000 B.C.

     [INLINE] However, unlike sheep, their ancestry is fairly clear. The
     major contributor of modern goats is the Bezoar goat which is
     distributed from the mountains of Asia Minor across the Middle East
     to Sind.
     Unlike sheep, goats easily revert to feral or wild condition given
     a chance. In fact, the only domestic species which will return to a
     wild state as rapidly as a goat is the domestic cat.
