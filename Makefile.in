# DIST: This is the distribution Makefile for XEmacs.  configure can
# DIST: make most of the changes to this file you might want, so try
# DIST: that first.

# make all	to compile and build XEmacs.
# make install	to install it.
# make TAGS	to update tags tables.
#
# make clean  or  make mostlyclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
#      created by building the program.	 Don't delete the files that
#      record the configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made
#      by building, but normally aren't because the distribution comes
#      with them.
#
#      Delete `.dvi' files here if they are not part of the distribution.
# 
# make distclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
#      configuring or building the program.  If you have unpacked the
#      source and built the program without creating any other files,
#      `make distclean' should leave only the files that were in the
#      distribution.
# 
# make realclean
#      Delete everything from the current directory that can be
#      reconstructed with this Makefile.  This typically includes
#      everything deleted by distclean, plus more: C source files
#      produced by Bison, tags tables, info files, and so on.
#
# make extraclean
#      Still more severe - delete backup and autosave files, too.

# ==================== Where To Install Things ====================

# The default location for installation.  Everything is placed in

# not need to change them.  This defaults to /usr/local.
prefix=@prefix@

# Like `prefix', but used for architecture-specific files.

# Where to install XEmacs and other binaries that people will want to
# run directly (like etags).
bindir=@bindir@

# Where to install architecture-independent data files.	 ${lispdir}
# and ${etcdir} are subdirectories of this.
datadir=@datadir@

# Where to install and expect the files that XEmacs modifies as it
# runs.	 These files are all architecture-independent. Right now, the
# only such data is the locking directory; ${lockdir} is a
# subdirectory of this.
statedir=@statedir@

# Where to install and expect executable files to be run by XEmacs
# rather than directly by users, and other architecture-dependent
# data.	 ${archlibdir} is a subdirectory of this.
libdir=@libdir@

# Where to install XEmacs's man pages, and what extension they should have.
mandir=@mandir@
manext=.1

# Where to install and expect the info files describing XEmacs.	In the

# ==================== XEmacs-specific directories ====================

# to this site (i.e. customizations), before consulting
# ${lispdir}.  This should be a colon-separated list of
# directories.
sitelispdir=@sitelispdir@

# Where XEmacs will search for its lisp files while
# building.  This is only used during the process of
# compiling XEmacs, to help XEmacs find its lisp files
# before they've been installed in their final location.
# It's usually identical to lispdir, except that the
# entry for the directory containing the installed lisp
# files has been replaced with ../lisp.  This should be a
# colon-separated list of directories.
buildlispdir=${srcdir}/lisp

# Where to install the other architecture-independent
# data files distributed with XEmacs (like the tutorial,
# the cookie recipes and the Zippy database). This path
# usually contains the XEmacs version number, so the data
# files for multiple versions of XEmacs may be installed
# at once.
etcdir=@etcdir@

# This is set to 'yes' if the user specified the --etcdir or
# --datadir flag at configuration time.
etcdir_user_defined=@etcdir_user_defined@

# Where to create and expect the locking directory, where
# the XEmacs locking code keeps track of which files are
# currently being edited.
lockdir=@lockdir@

# This is set to 'yes' if the user specified the --lockdir or
# --statedir flag at configuration time.
lockdir_user_defined=@lockdir_user_defined@

# Where to put executables to be run by XEmacs rather than
# the user.  This path usually includes the XEmacs version
# and configuration name, so that multiple configurations
# for multiple versions of XEmacs may be installed at
# once.

# ==================== Installation ====================

## If we let lib-src do its own installation, that means we
## don't have to duplicate the list of utilities to install in
## this Makefile as well.

## On AIX, use tar xBf.
## On Xenix, use tar xpf.

.PHONY: install install-arch-dep install-arch-indep mkdir

## We delete each directory in ${COPYDESTS} before we copy into it;
## that way, we can reinstall over directories that have been put in
## place with their files read-only (perhaps because they are checked
## into RCS).  In order to make this safe, we make sure that the
## source exists and is distinct from the destination.

## FSF doesn't depend on `all', but rather on ${MAKE_SUBDIR}, so that
## they "won't ever modify src/paths.h".  But that means you can't do
## 'make install' right off the bat because src/paths.h won't exist.
## And, in XEmacs case, src/Emacs.ad.h won't exist either.  I also
## don't see the point in avoiding modifying paths.h.  It creates an
## inconsistency in the build process.  So we go ahead and depend on
## all.  --cet

### Unlocking and relocking.  The idea of these productions is to reduce
### hassles when installing an incremental tar of XEmacs.  Do `make unlock'
### before unlocking the file to take the write locks off all sources so
### that tar xvof will overwrite them without fuss.  Then do `make relock'
### afterward so that VC mode will know which files should be checked in
### if you want to mung them.
###
### Note: it's no disaster if these productions miss a file or two; tar
### and VC will swiftly let you know if this happens, and it is easily
### corrected.
